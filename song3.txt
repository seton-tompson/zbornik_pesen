Torn

I thought I saw a man brought to life
He was warm, he came around like he was dignified
He showed me what it was to cry
Well you couldn′t be that man I adored

You don′t seem to know, don′t seem to care what your heart is for
But I don′t know him anymore
There′s nothing where he used to lie
My conversation has run dry
